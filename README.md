## About

`kokoro-tts-tool` is a Python CLI tool built with modern tooling and best practices.

## Features

- ✅ Type-safe with mypy strict mode
- ✅ Linted with ruff
- ✅ Tested with pytest
- 📊 Multi-level verbosity logging (-v/-vv/-vvv)
- 🐚 Shell completion for bash, zsh, and fish
- 🔒 Security scanning with bandit, pip-audit, and gitleaks
- ✅ Modern Python tooling (uv, mise, click)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Install from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dnvriend/kokoro-tts-tool.git
cd kokoro-tts-tool

# Install globally with uv
uv tool install .
```

### Install with mise (recommended for development)

```bash
cd kokoro-tts-tool
mise trust
mise install
uv sync
uv tool install .
```

### Verify installation

```bash
kokoro-tts-tool --version
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Show help
kokoro-tts-tool --help

# Run the tool
kokoro-tts-tool

# Run with verbose output
kokoro-tts-tool -v      # INFO level
kokoro-tts-tool -vv     # DEBUG level
kokoro-tts-tool -vvv    # TRACE level (includes library internals)
```

## Multi-Level Verbosity Logging

The CLI supports progressive verbosity levels for debugging and troubleshooting. All logs output to stderr, keeping stdout clean for data piping.

### Logging Levels

| Flag | Level | Output | Use Case |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| (none) | WARNING | Errors and warnings only | Production, quiet mode |
| `-v` | INFO | + High-level operations | Normal debugging |
| `-vv` | DEBUG | + Detailed info, full tracebacks | Development, troubleshooting |
| `-vvv` | TRACE | + Library internals | Deep debugging |

### Examples

```bash
# Quiet mode - only errors and warnings
kokoro-tts-tool

# INFO - see operations and progress
kokoro-tts-tool -v
# Output:
# [INFO] kokoro-tts-tool started
# [INFO] kokoro-tts-tool completed

# DEBUG - see detailed information
kokoro-tts-tool -vv
# Output:
# [INFO] kokoro-tts-tool started
# [DEBUG] Running with verbose level: 2
# [INFO] kokoro-tts-tool completed

# TRACE - see library internals (configure in logging_config.py)
kokoro-tts-tool -vvv
```

### Customizing Library Logging

To enable DEBUG logging for third-party libraries at TRACE level (-vvv), edit `kokoro_tts_tool/logging_config.py`:

```python
# Configure dependent library loggers at TRACE level (-vvv)
if verbose_count >= 3:
    logging.getLogger("requests").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    logging.getLogger("urllib3").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    # Add your project-specific library loggers here
```

## Shell Completion

The CLI provides native shell completion for bash, zsh, and fish shells.

### Supported Shells

| Shell | Version Requirement | Status |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **Bash** | ≥ 4.4 | ✅ Supported |
| **Zsh** | Any recent version | ✅ Supported |
| **Fish** | ≥ 3.0 | ✅ Supported |
| **PowerShell** | Any version | ❌ Not Supported |

### Installation

#### Quick Setup (Temporary)

```bash
# Bash - active for current session only
eval "$(kokoro-tts-tool completion bash)"

# Zsh - active for current session only
eval "$(kokoro-tts-tool completion zsh)"

# Fish - active for current session only
kokoro-tts-tool completion fish | source
```

#### Permanent Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Bash - add to ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(kokoro-tts-tool completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Zsh - add to ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(kokoro-tts-tool completion zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Fish - save to completions directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
kokoro-tts-tool completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/kokoro-tts-tool.fish
```

#### File-based Installation (Better Performance)

For better shell startup performance, generate completion scripts to files:

```bash
# Bash
kokoro-tts-tool completion bash > ~/.kokoro-tts-tool-complete.bash
echo 'source ~/.kokoro-tts-tool-complete.bash' >> ~/.bashrc

# Zsh
kokoro-tts-tool completion zsh > ~/.kokoro-tts-tool-complete.zsh
echo 'source ~/.kokoro-tts-tool-complete.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc

# Fish (automatic loading from completions directory)
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
kokoro-tts-tool completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/kokoro-tts-tool.fish
```

### Usage

Once installed, completion works automatically:

```bash
# Tab completion for commands
kokoro-tts-tool <TAB>
# Shows: completion

# Tab completion for options
kokoro-tts-tool --<TAB>
# Shows: --verbose --version --help

# Tab completion for shell types
kokoro-tts-tool completion <TAB>
# Shows: bash zsh fish
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# View completion installation instructions
kokoro-tts-tool completion --help
```

# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with verbose output
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_utils.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=kokoro_tts_tool
```

## Security

The project includes lightweight security tools providing 80%+ coverage with fast scan times:

### Security Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Speed | Coverage |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| **bandit** | Python code security linting | ⚡⚡ Fast | SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe functions |
| **pip-audit** | Dependency vulnerability scanning | ⚡⚡ Fast | Known CVEs in dependencies |
| **gitleaks** | Secret and API key detection | ⚡⚡⚡ Very Fast | Secrets in code and git history |

### Running Security Scans

```bash
# Run all security checks (~5-8 seconds)
make security

# Or run individually
make security-bandit       # Python security linting
make security-pip-audit    # Dependency CVE scanning
make security-gitleaks     # Secret detection
```

### Prerequisites

gitleaks must be installed separately:

```bash
# macOS
brew install gitleaks

# Linux
# See: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#installation
```

Security checks run automatically in `make check` and `make pipeline`.

### What's Protected

- ✅ AWS credentials (AKIA*, ASIA*, etc.)
- ✅ GitHub tokens (ghp_*, gho_*, etc.)
- ✅ API keys and secrets
- ✅ Private keys
- ✅ Slack tokens
- ✅ 100+ other secret types
